This example will utilise a file from EUMETSAT CM SAF. We will work with a NetCDF file of monthly sunshine duration over Europe for the single time point of August 2018 from the Interim Climate Data Record. 
This data file should be provided along with this script and is called SDUms201808010000401UD1000101UD.nc. Put this data file in the same folder as this script is in.
